# Coverage probe: observed status on kgateway v2.4.5

Everything below was observed on the live cluster (minikube `kgw-argocd`), not predicted. `GatewayExtension` is out of scope (writes no status on v2.4.5). Manifests are in `manifests/coverage/`; the Application is `argocd/app-coverage.yaml`.

## CRD spec fields (Step 1)

- ListenerPolicy: `default, perPort, targetRefs, targetSelectors`
- BackendConfigPolicy: `circuitBreakers, commonHttpProtocolOptions, connectTimeout, dns, healthCheck, http1ProtocolOptions, http2ProtocolOptions, loadBalancer, outlierDetection, perConnectionBufferLimitBytes, targetRefs, targetSelectors, tcpKeepalive, tls, upstreamProxyProtocol` (`tls.secretRef` exists)
- DirectResponse: `body, bodyFormat, status`

## Predicted vs observed

| Resource | Predicted | Observed |
|---|---|---|
| ListenerPolicy `lp-healthy` | Accepted+Attached True | As predicted. Ancestor Gateway `httpbin/demo-gateway`. |
| ListenerPolicy `lp-unattached` (targets nonexistent Gateway) | No status | **No `status` field at all**, still none after 60s+. |
| ListenerPolicy `lp-degraded-ca` (caCertificateRefs to a missing ConfigMap) | Degraded | **Not Degraded**: `Accepted=True/Valid`, `Attached=True/Attached`. |
| ListenerPolicy `lp-degraded-accesslog` (accessLog grpcService backendRef to a missing Service) | Degraded | **Degraded**: `Accepted=False/Invalid` ("unresolved backend reference: Service httpbin/no-such-log-service not found"), `Attached=False/Pending` (empty message). Ancestor Gateway `coverage-gateway-log`. |
| BackendConfigPolicy `bcp-healthy` | Accepted+Attached True | As predicted. Ancestor is the **Backend** `httpbin/coverage-backend` (`group: gateway.kgateway.dev`), not a Gateway. |
| BackendConfigPolicy `bcp-degraded` (tls.secretRef to a missing Secret) | Degraded | **Degraded**: `Accepted=False/Invalid` ("failed to extract TLS data: Secret httpbin/no-such-tls-secret not found"), `Attached=False/Pending`. |
| DirectResponse `dr-healthy` | Accepted+Attached True | As predicted. Ancestor is Gateway `demo-gateway` (not the referencing HTTPRoute). |
| DirectResponse `dr-unreferenced` | No status | **No `status` field at all**, still none after 60s+. |

Not tried for DirectResponse: a route referencing it whose parent Gateway does not exist (optional candidate, skipped). "No Degraded reachable" is therefore established for DirectResponse only for the one mechanism tried.

## Blocking question: do the three kinds carry Accepted + Attached against a Gateway ancestor?

All three write `status.ancestors[]` with `controllerName: kgateway.dev/kgateway` and condition types `Accepted` and `Attached`; healthy reasons are `Valid` and `Attached`. Unhealthy reasons are `Invalid` (Accepted) and `Pending` (Attached, empty message). Ancestor kind: **Gateway** for ListenerPolicy and DirectResponse; **Backend** for BackendConfigPolicy. Whether the shared ancestors script copes with a Backend ancestor and with `Invalid`/`Pending` is for Tasks 3/4 to check before reusing it unchanged.

## Findings

1. **A failing policy surfaces on the status of its target, not only on the policy.**
   - BackendConfigPolicy: with `bcp-degraded` targeting the demo's `Backend/httpbin-static`, that Backend went `Accepted=False/Invalid` (`Backend error: "gateway.kgateway.dev/BackendConfigPolicy/httpbin/bcp-degraded: failed to extract TLS data: ..."`), `kgw-demo` went Degraded and the source of the tracked `Backend/testdata/healthy.yaml` was corrupted. After the fix synced, `httpbin-static` returned to `Accepted=True/Accepted`, "Backend accepted", `observedGeneration: 21`, identical to the tracked fixture apart from `lastTransitionTime`.
   - ListenerPolicy: the same happens to Gateways. `lp-degraded-accesslog` put its target `coverage-gateway-log` into `Accepted=False/GatewayReplaced` with the policy's message, while `Programmed` stayed True. The Argo health check reports the Gateway Degraded with that message. **Coverage resources must never target demo resources** (the first manifests did, and were fixed with `coverage-backend` and dedicated Gateways).
   - The error is per target, not per policy: `bcp-healthy` stays Accepted+Attached True while `coverage-backend` itself is `Accepted=False/Invalid` because of its sibling.
2. **Contrast between two reference fields.** A missing Secret in BackendConfigPolicy `tls.secretRef` and a missing Service in ListenerPolicy `accessLog[].grpcService.backendRef` are rejected (`Invalid`). A missing ConfigMap in ListenerPolicy `clientCertificateValidation.caCertificateRefs` is **accepted** (`Valid`/`Attached`). Two reference-type fields, two behaviours. Whether that is a kgateway bug is not decided here.
3. **Port 8082 is reserved by kgateway.** A Gateway listener on 8082 came out `Programmed=False/Invalid` with `invalid port 8082 in listener: port is reserved`; a ListenerPolicy targeting it got no status at all. Avoid 8082 in any extension of this demo.
4. **Unattached and unreferenced resources get no status** (`lp-unattached`, `dr-unreferenced`): the controller writes ancestors only once something attaches. That looks correct, not a bug. The health script must treat an absent status as Progressing.
5. **Degraded is reachable for ListenerPolicy** (accesslog backendRef) and BackendConfigPolicy. For DirectResponse, no Degraded was reached with the single mechanism tried.
6. **`kgw-coverage` is Synced/Degraded**, not Healthy. The Degraded comes from the *existing* Backend and Gateway health checks seeing `Backend/coverage-backend` (policy error) and `Gateway/coverage-gateway-log` (policy error). The three new kinds have no health check yet and show blank health (`BackendConfigPolicy`, `DirectResponse`, `ListenerPolicy` resources all have empty health in the Application resource list). `kgw-demo` is Synced/Healthy; `kgw-scenarios` is Synced/Degraded.

## Fixtures: capture source per kind

Name each fixture file after the state actually captured. Capture the **policy** resource for the policy-kind fixtures. Backend/Gateway are only needed for the existing Backend/Gateway checks, not the new ones.

| Kind | Healthy fixture, from | Degraded fixture, from | No-status fixture, from |
|---|---|---|---|
| ListenerPolicy | `httpbin/lp-healthy` | `httpbin/lp-degraded-accesslog` (NOT `lp-degraded-ca`, which is Accepted/Valid) | `httpbin/lp-unattached` |
| BackendConfigPolicy | `httpbin/bcp-healthy` | `httpbin/bcp-degraded` (the policy; `Backend/coverage-backend` carries the surfaced error but is a Backend-kind fixture, not a BackendConfigPolicy one) | none observed |
| DirectResponse | `httpbin/dr-healthy` | none reachable | `httpbin/dr-unreferenced` |

`httpbin/lp-degraded-ca` is an additional healthy-looking capture (Accepted/Valid with a dangling reference) if a fixture for that contrast is wanted. Never capture from `Backend/httpbin-static` or `Gateway/demo-gateway` for coverage purposes.
