# Assembles out/resource_customizations/gateway.kgateway.dev/ -- a
# drop-in-ready tree for an argo-cd clone -- from this repo's TRACKED
# content under healthchecks/lua/<Kind>/ (health.lua, health_test.yaml,
# testdata/), and refreshes the 12 LIVE-CAPTURED testdata fixtures from the
# current cluster before assembling.
#
# IMPORTANT -- what this script writes, and what it never touches:
#   - The 12 `extract()` calls below overwrite TRACKED source files under
#     healthchecks/lua/<Kind>/testdata/ directly (not just their copies in
#     out/) -- those tracked files ARE the source of truth for these fixtures,
#     since out/ is gitignored and regenerated. Re-run this script any time the
#     live cluster's status for these resources changes and you want the
#     tracked fixtures to reflect it.
#   - The other 9 of the 21 fixtures are never written by this script:
#       * 7 DERIVED/asserted: Backend/no_status, ListenerPolicy/
#         foreign_controller, TrafficPolicy/{stale,foreign_controller,
#         overridden,overridden_empty_message,partially_valid}.
#       * 1 hand-captured: Backend/stale, a real capture taken mid-probe that
#         cannot be reproduced on demand.
#       * 1 SYNTHETIC: TrafficPolicy/wrong_shape, a state kgateway never
#         produces.
#     See each file's own header comment for exactly what was substituted. They
#     cannot be reproduced by capturing a live resource, and this script NEVER
#     writes those nine filenames -- only the 12 named in the `extract` calls
#     below -- so a re-run cannot silently destroy them.
#
# Strips managedFields/uid/resourceVersion/creationTimestamp/annotations --
# noise that upstream's existing fixtures do not carry -- but keeps the
# status subresource completely intact, which is the entire point of the
# fixture.
#
# YAML tooling note: this machine's python3 has no PyYAML module, so the
# original round-trip-through-python approach in the task brief doesn't
# work here. `yq` (mikefarah/yq, Go implementation) is installed, so we
# fetch each resource as JSON via `kubectl -o json` (guaranteed valid JSON,
# no YAML-parsing edge cases) and let `yq -P` convert JSON -> YAML while
# deleting the noisy fields with a single `del()` expression. Output stays
# YAML, as argo-cd's fixtures require.
# SKIP_REFRESH=1 skips the 12 live captures and assembles the tree from the
# fixtures already committed under healthchecks/lua/<Kind>/testdata/. That makes
# this script runnable with no cluster and no kubectl -- which is what lets CI
# verify the Lua and the generated patch. The refresh is the ONLY part that
# needs a cluster; assembly is pure file copying.

  # demo cluster is rebuilt:
  #
  #   lastTransitionTime  never read by any health check. Masked outright.
  #   generation /        read ONLY as a comparison -- isStale() asks whether
